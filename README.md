# Developing a database (Microsoft SQL Server), Importing data, SQL Queries to join and append tables, Exporting to Power BI, Developing visualisations and report

Problem statement:
- is the hotel revenue growing by year?
- should the hotel increase its parking lot?
- what trends can be seen in the data?

Business objective:
- Build a visual story or dashboard using Power BI to present to stakeholders.

# My approach:

1. I setup a database using Microsoft SQL Server 2025, cleaned data in Microsoft Excel and loaded different sheets as differenct tables onto the SQL Server.
2. I then wrote SQL queries to append and then left join the tables to create one cohesive data set (flat model) to be imported into Power BI.
3. The data was imported into Power Bi where I created serveral new calculated columns using DAX.
4. An insightful report was created that gave answers to the questions asked by stakeholders.
